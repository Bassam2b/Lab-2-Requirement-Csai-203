## Brief Description of the Task
This project involves developing a simple Football Quiz Web Application using Flask. The web application consists of three main parts:

- **Login Page**: Users input their email and password to start the quiz.
- **Quiz Page**: Users answer football-related questions, including multiple-choice and fill-in-the-gap formats.
- **Result Page**: After submitting the quiz, users are shown their score based on the number of correct answers.
The front-end uses HTML and CSS for the design, while Flask handles the back-end processing, validating user inputs, and calculating the final quiz score.

## Instructions for Running the Project
- **Clone the repository**: Download the project files from the GitHub repository.
- **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the terminal to move to the directory containing the project files.
- **Install the required dependencies**: Use pip to install Flask, which is required to run the application.
Run the Flask application: Start the server and run the web application locally.
Access the application: Open your web browser and go to the specified address to interact with the application.
### Complete the workflow:
First, enter your email and password on the login page.
Then, answer the football-related quiz on the next page.
Finally, submit the quiz to see your score.
